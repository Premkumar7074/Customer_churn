Problem Statement:
1. Despite the continuous efforts of banks to attract and retain customers, the banking industry faces a persistent challenge in the form of customer churn, leading to financial losses and reduced customer satisfaction.
2. It is advantageous for banks to know what leads a client towards the decision to leave the company.

Project Objective:- 1. The aim of this project is to analyze the customer churn rate for bank because it is useful to understand why the customers leave.
2. After Analyzing we need to train a Machine Learning Model which can find the key factors that significantly influence the customer churn or attrition.
3. In the end will choose the most reliable model that will attach a probability to the churn to make it easier for customer service to target right customer in order to minimize their efforts to prevent customers churn.

Project Overview:
1. Churn refers to customers leaving a bank or discontinuing their banking services.
2. Banking Churn Analysis is a process of studying customer behavior in the banking industry to predict and understand customer attrition or churn.
3. Banking Churn Modeling aims to identify patterns and factors that contribute to customer churn, enabling banks to take proactive measures to retain customers and improve customer satisfaction.
